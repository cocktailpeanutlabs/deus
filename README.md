# What is different about deus?

1. **Realtime Native:** Unlike many image generation web UIs, DEUS is designed from scratch with an assumption that images are generated in realtime, which opens doors to various unique features.
2. **Simple:** If you know how to use Google, and know how to draw, you know how to use DEUS.
3. **Intutitive:** Just enter what you want, drag and drop images, and draw. The combination of these simple actions lets you gradually create exactly what you want, without having to learn any complicated tech and jargon.

# Features

## 1. Text Prompt

Generate images in realtime as you type

## 2. Draw

## 3. Remix

The ultra-fluid UI lets you "breed" new images simply by dragging and dropping generated images into the canvas.
